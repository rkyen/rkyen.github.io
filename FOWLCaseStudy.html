        <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">My Design Story</h3>
        <p class="font-weight-lighter text-black-50">During my junior year in college, I first learned about the concept of design. I came to realize that design applies to not just my major in software engineering but, with everyday things. I became extremely fascinated with it and tried to learn design while I was in school. I took some short online design classes to supplement my education. However, the software courses I did not enjoy took priority and I couldnâ€™t pursue my interest in design. I looked to switch majors, but, financially, it didn't make sense. I gave up on that pursuit and after graduation, I immediately went on to work at a startup that ultimately flopped. After the startup,I took on a stable job and spent my time on my passions.</p>

<p class="font-weight-lighter text-black-50">That rediscovery period led me to apply and attend Lambda School. During the day, I am working as a customer support engineer, responding to tickets and calls from real estate agents and brokers for, SaaS platform, Real Geeks. At this job I have acquired a lot of soft skills and empathetic skills. In addition, I have a background in Software Engineering and have personally spent some time poking around in design. I have had some experience working with developers, business stakeholders, and as a former developer myself. I now want to take the empathetic soft skills and pair it with my technical/analytical skills to become the best UX designer I can be. </p>
